## Testing 

All buttons have been tested to ensure correct results were recorded in the Javascript section.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

## Credits 

For the main game function for the Javascript a tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFeg0cEZvQ  was used. 
- This was used to ensure the script was not only functional but was susinct and easily read. 

For the hover effect for buttons the transition tutorial was used from here, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-button-style-hover-color-and-background/. 
- This was used as this is not an effect that I have come across yet, and I thought the transition looked nice on the buttons.
